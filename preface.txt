Preface

Hagakure is the essential book of the Samurai. Written by
Yamamoto Tsunetomo, who was a Samurai in the early 1700s,
it is a book that combines the teachings of both Zen and Con-
fucianism. These philosophies are centered on loyalty, devotion,
purity and selﬂessness, and Yamamoto places a strong emphasis
on the notion of living in the present moment with a strong and
clear mind.

The Samurai were knights who defended and fought for their
lords at a time when useful farming land was scarce and in
need of protection. They believed in duty, and gave themselves
completely to their masters. The Samurai believed that only
after transcending all fear could they obtain peace of mind and
yield the power to serve their masters faithfully and loyally even
in the face of death.

The word Hagakure literally translates as hidden beneath
the leaves and also fallen leaves. Perhaps it was named this
because at the time that it was written, the way of the samurai
was becoming obsolete.

The Hagakure has been rewritten in modern terms by one
of Japan’s famous writers, Yukio Mishima. His own views were
very similar to those of Yamamoto, particularly the philosophy
of cultivating the self. His characters all had self suﬃciency in
common, and did not rely upon anyone else for completion.

Although the Hagakure was written centuries ago for a breed
of warriors that no longer exist, the philosophies and wisdom
within are still practical, even in our modern times.
